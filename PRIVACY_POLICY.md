# PhotoLynk Privacy Policy

**Last Updated**: December 4, 2024

## Overview
PhotoLynk is a self-hosted photo backup application. We do not collect, store, or share any personal data on external servers.

## Data Collection
PhotoLynk collects and stores the following data **only on YOUR server**:

- **Photos and Videos**: Stored on the server you control
- **Email Address**: Used for authentication, stored locally on your server
- **Device UUID**: Used for device binding and security, stored on your server
- **File Metadata**: Filenames, sizes, and hashes for deduplication

## Data Storage
All data is stored on the server YOU control. We (the app developers) have **no access** to your data. Your photos, credentials, and metadata never leave your server unless you explicitly configure remote access.

## Data Usage
- **Authentication**: Email and password are used solely for login
- **Device Binding**: Device UUID ensures only your device can access your account
- **File Deduplication**: File hashes prevent duplicate uploads
- **No Analytics**: We do not collect usage statistics or analytics

## Third-Party Services
PhotoLynk does **not** use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools. Your data stays on your server.

## Data Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties because we do not have access to your data. All data remains on your self-hosted server.

## Your Rights
You have complete control over your data:
- **Access**: All data is on your server
- **Deletion**: Delete your server or user account to remove all data
- **Portability**: All files are stored in standard formats
- **Control**: You own and control the server

## Security
- Device-bound authentication prevents unauthorized access
- HTTPS support for encrypted data transmission
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- No data stored on external servers

## Children's Privacy
PhotoLynk does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. Since all data is self-hosted, parents have full control over what data is stored.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on our GitHub repository.
